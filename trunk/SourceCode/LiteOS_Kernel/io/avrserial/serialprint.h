/** \defgroup serial Serial port operations 
\par Overview
The serial port operations contain both sending and receiving packets over the serial port. This module is useful for debugging purposes, among others. 
\par Initilization
There is no explicit initilization needed. The usart hardware is initilized the first time a byte is sent over it. 
\par Sending operations 
Basically to send, it may use the following functions to do this purpose. 
- printInteger()
- printString()
- printStringN()
- usartPrint()
On the other hand, if the user application intends to send through serial over the system calls, it needs to first call getSerialInfo(), then call SocketSerialSend() to 
send out the data. 
\par Receiving operations
For receiving packets through the serial port, the following function APIs are provided. 
First, the initSerialHandles() function must be invoked to init the serial data structure. 
Then, the registerEventSerial() and deRegisterEventSerial() are used by the kernel to register event handlers for the serial packet.
Finally, the getSerialHandleInfo() and syscall_registerEventSerial() are used by user applications to invoke the receive handler setup routines.
