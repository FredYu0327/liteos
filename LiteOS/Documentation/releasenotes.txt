  Improvements:
        Improved response time of command cp
        Improved robustness of the shell by adding command semantics and vaildness check
        Improved kernel robustness by checking binary validness: if a binary application tries to allocate
        memory that has conflict with the other threads, it will not be loaded. 
        Improved uisp installation procedure. Now more compatible with different environments and fewer possible conflicts. 
 
  Major bug fixes:
        Fixed the bug on "cd .." at root directory
        Fixed the bug of creating new directories in the node level 
        Fixed the bug that sometimes executation of a binary will make the node no longer responding
